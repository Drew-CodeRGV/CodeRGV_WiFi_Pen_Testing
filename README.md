# DFS Pulse Tester

Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) is a mechanism that allows a radio device to dynamically select or change the operating frequency to avoid interfering with other systems, such as local weather radar systems. This GNU Radio Companion (GRC) flow graph **emulates radar signal patterns for DFS testing** using a suitable Software Defined Radio (SDR), such as the HackRF One. You can select the center frequency and type of radar signature.

For more information on DFS in the context of Wi-Fi systems see [A Practical Introduction to Dynamic Frequency Selection](https://www.adriangranados.com/blog/practical-intro-dfs).
